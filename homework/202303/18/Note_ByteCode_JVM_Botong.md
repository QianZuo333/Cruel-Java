Java bytecode is a compiled code that is generated by the Java compiler from Java source code. It is a machine-independent code that can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java bytecode is an intermediate representation of Java code, which is designed to be interpreted by the JVM at runtime.

When Java source code is compiled, it is translated into Java bytecode, which is stored in .class files. The JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode by interpreting it at runtime. The JVM takes care of loading the bytecode, verifying its correctness, and executing it on the host machine.

The Java bytecode is designed to be portable, secure, and platform-independent. This means that Java programs can be written once and run anywhere, as long as the target platform has a JVM installed. The JVM provides a layer of abstraction between the Java bytecode and the underlying operating system, allowing Java programs to be run on any platform without modification.

In summary, Java bytecode is a compiled code that is generated from Java source code, which is designed to be executed by the JVM at runtime. The JVM is responsible for interpreting and executing the bytecode on the target platform, which makes Java programs portable, secure, and platform-independent.
