The JVM divides the heap memory into different regions, each with its own garbage collector. These regions include the young generation, the old generation, and the permanent generation.

The young generation is where new objects are created, and it is divided into two parts: the Eden space and the survivor space. When objects are first created, they are placed in the Eden space. The garbage collector in the young generation performs a process called "copying collection," where it identifies objects that are still being referenced and moves them to the survivor space. Objects that are no longer referenced are removed from memory.

In the survivor space, the garbage collector performs a process called "mark-and-sweep" to identify and remove any objects that are no longer referenced. The objects that are still being referenced are moved to the old generation, which is where long-lived objects are stored.

The old generation is where objects that have survived multiple garbage collections are stored. The garbage collector in the old generation performs a process called "mark-and-compact," where it identifies and removes any unreferenced objects and then moves the surviving objects to the beginning of the heap, which is called compaction.

The permanent generation is where metadata about the Java classes and methods are stored. The garbage collector in the permanent generation performs a process called "class unloading," where it identifies classes that are no longer needed and removes them from memory.
