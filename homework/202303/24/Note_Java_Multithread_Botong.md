In Java, both the synchronized keyword and the Lock interface from the java.util.concurrent.locks package are used for synchronization and thread safety. However, there are some differences between the two:

Locking granularity: synchronized provides intrinsic locks that are associated with an object or a method, while Lock provides explicit locks that can be associated with specific sections of code. This gives more fine-grained control over locking and can be more efficient in some cases.

Fairness: The Lock interface provides a way to specify whether locks should be granted on a first-come, first-served basis (fair) or whether threads should compete for the lock (unfair). The synchronized keyword always uses a fair locking policy.

Interruptibility: The Lock interface provides a way to interrupt a thread that is waiting for a lock to become available, using the lockInterruptibly() method. With synchronized, a thread that is waiting for a lock cannot be interrupted.

Multiple conditions: The Lock interface provides a way to create multiple conditions that can be used to coordinate between threads waiting for specific conditions to be met. This is not possible with synchronized.

In general, synchronized is simpler and easier to use, while Lock provides more flexibility and control over locking. However, the choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the application and the complexity of the synchronization needed. In practice, both synchronized and Lock can be used effectively for thread synchronization and thread safety in Java.
