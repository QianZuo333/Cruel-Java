Memory allocation in the JVM is managed by the garbage collector, which is responsible for freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the program. Here's a brief overview of how memory allocation works in the JVM:

Heap memory: The JVM uses a heap to store objects created by the program. The heap is a region of memory that is shared by all threads in the program. It is divided into generations, which are regions of memory that are used for different purposes.

New objects: When a new object is created, the JVM allocates memory for it on the heap. The size of the memory allocation is determined by the size of the object and the alignment requirements of the JVM.

Garbage collection: As the program runs, objects that are no longer being used are identified by the garbage collector. The garbage collector frees up memory by reclaiming memory used by these objects.

Heap structure: The heap is divided into different regions, including the young generation and the old generation. The young generation is where new objects are initially allocated. When the young generation fills up, the garbage collector identifies objects that are still in use and promotes them to the old generation.

Tuning: The JVM provides a range of options for tuning the garbage collector, such as setting the size of the heap, the size of the generations, and the algorithm used by the garbage collector.
