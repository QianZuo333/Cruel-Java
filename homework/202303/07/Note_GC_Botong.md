Garbage collection is a critical component of memory management in the JVM. It is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by the program. Here's a brief overview of how garbage collection works in the JVM:

Mark and sweep algorithm: The most commonly used garbage collection algorithm in the JVM is the mark and sweep algorithm. This algorithm works by first marking all objects that are still in use by the program, and then sweeping through the heap to identify and remove objects that are no longer in use.

Heap structure: The heap is divided into different regions, including the young generation and the old generation. The young generation is where new objects are initially allocated, and is further divided into an "Eden" space and two "Survivor" spaces. When the young generation fills up, the garbage collector identifies objects that are still in use and promotes them to the old generation.

Generational collection: The JVM uses a generational collection approach, which takes advantage of the fact that most objects have a short lifespan. By focusing on collecting garbage in the young generation, the garbage collector can avoid the overhead of examining objects in the old generation that are likely to still be in use.

Minor collection: Minor garbage collection is triggered when the young generation fills up. The garbage collector first identifies live objects in the young generation, and then moves them to one of the Survivor spaces. Objects that survive multiple minor collections are eventually promoted to the old generation.

Major collection: Major garbage collection is triggered when the old generation fills up. This is a more time-consuming process, as it involves examining all objects in the old generation. During a major collection, the garbage collector identifies live objects and compacts them to reduce fragmentation.

Tuning: The JVM provides a range of options for tuning the garbage collector, such as setting the size of the heap, the size of the generations, and the algorithm used by the garbage collector. Tuning the garbage collector can be important for achieving optimal performance for a specific application.

Overall, garbage collection in the JVM is an automatic process that frees up memory that is no longer being used by the program. The JVM uses a range of techniques, including generational collection and the mark and sweep algorithm, to efficiently manage memory and avoid the overhead of examining objects that are still in use.
