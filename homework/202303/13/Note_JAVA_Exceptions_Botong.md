In Java, there are two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked exceptions.

Checked Exceptions: Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, and the programmer is required to handle them explicitly. This is done by surrounding the code that can throw the checked exception with a try-catch block or by declaring the exception in the method signature using the "throws" keyword. Examples of checked exceptions include IOException, SQLException, and ClassNotFoundException.

Unchecked Exceptions: Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, and the programmer is not required to handle them explicitly. These exceptions are usually the result of a programming error, such as a null pointer dereference, and are thrown at runtime. Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException.

In addition to checked and unchecked exceptions, there is also a third type of exception called Errors. Errors are not meant to be caught by the programmer, as they usually indicate a serious problem with the system, such as OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError.
